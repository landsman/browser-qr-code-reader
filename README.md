# browser-qr-code-reader

read QR codes in browser extension

## Use case

I see QR code on the page and I want to decode it.
Let's put there support for pretty JSON if it's detected, URLs, emails etc.

In App Store is not any extension like this, only generators, not readers. I was looking for extension for Safari.
